the above line only added array to the FIRST document in my collection, not all.

I'm stopping here and moving onto mongoose.


	8.	Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
	9.	Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
	10.	Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
	11.	Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
	12.	Remove all students who are from California.
	13.	Remove a student by name. 
	14.	Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
